## 🔧 Known Issue to Fix

### Voting Error: "User doesn't exist"

**Problem**: When you vote, it says user doesn't exist in database.

**Cause**: After Privy login, the user needs to complete profile setup to be added to database.

**Solution**: 
1. After login, you should see "Complete Your Profile" form
2. Fill in: College Name, City, State
3. This creates the user in database
4. Then voting will work

**If profile setup doesn't show automatically:**
- Logout and login again
- The modal should detect you're not in database and show profile setup

## 🐛 Debugging the Voting Issue

If voting still doesn't work after profile setup:

### Check 1: Is user in database?
```bash
npx prisma studio
```
- Open User table
- Look for your email
- If not there, profile setup didn't work

### Check 2: Check browser console
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Click Console tab
- Try to vote
- Look for error messages

### Check 3: Check API response
- Open DevTools → Network tab
- Try to vote
- Click on "vote" request
- Look at Response tab
- Should show the error message

## 🔄 Quick Fix Commands

### Restart everything:
```bash
# Kill dev server
pkill -f "next dev"

# Restart
npm run dev
```

### Check database connection:
```bash
npx prisma studio
```

### Add yourself as admin manually:
```bash
npx tsx -e "
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
const prisma = new PrismaClient();
prisma.admin.create({
  data: { email: 'dhruv.223217@pyramidcollege.edu.in' }
}).then(() => console.log('Admin added')).finally(() => prisma.\$disconnect());
"
```

## 📝 Summary

**What works:**
- ✅ Database connected
- ✅ UI looks like original
- ✅ Login works
- ✅ Colleges display
- ✅ Filters work
- ✅ Admin panel works

**What needs testing:**
- ⚠️ Profile setup after login
- ⚠️ Voting (after profile is set up)

**The issue is likely:** Profile setup modal not showing after Privy login, so user never gets added to database.

**Solution:** Make sure after you login with Privy, you see the "Complete Your Profile" form. If not, logout and login again.
