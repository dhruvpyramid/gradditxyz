## 🚀 Next Steps to Launch

### 1. Set Up Database (REQUIRED)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/graddit"

# Privy (already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID="cmbi8jxhs000zju0mbg0xx3v3"
```

Then run migrations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Add Yourself as Admin

After database is created, run this SQL:

```sql
INSERT INTO "Admin" (id, email, "createdAt") 
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'your-email@example.com', NOW());
```

Replace `your-email@example.com` with your actual email.

### 3. Start the App

npm run dev
```

## 📊 How Voting Works

### Example Scenario:

**Votes**:

2. DTU (same state: Delhi) → Weight: 1.2x
3. IIT Bombay (different state) → Weight: 1.0x

**Score Calculation**:
- IIT Delhi: +1 vote × 1.5 = +1.5 score
- DTU: +1 vote × 1.2 = +1.2 score
- IIT Bombay: +1 vote × 1.0 = +1.0 score

### "Must use .edu.in email"
