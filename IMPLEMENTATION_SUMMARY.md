## 🎓 College Autocomplete Details

### How It Works:
1. User types in college name input
2. After 2 characters → fetch all colleges from API
3. Filter colleges client-side (fast, instant search)
4. Show top 5 matches in dropdown
5. User clicks a suggestion
6. College name, city, state auto-filled

### Smart Features:
- **Case-insensitive search:** "iit" matches "IIT Delhi"
- **Partial match:** "delhi" matches "IIT Delhi", "DU Delhi"
- **Live updates:** Filters as you type
- **Keyboard navigation:** Can use arrow keys (future enhancement)
- **Click outside to close:** Dropdown disappears

### Example:
```
User types: "iit d"
Suggestions:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ IIT Delhi                       │
│ New Delhi, Delhi                │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ IIT Dharwad                     │
│ Dharwad, Karnataka              │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ IIT Dhanbad                     │
│ Dhanbad, Jharkhand              │
