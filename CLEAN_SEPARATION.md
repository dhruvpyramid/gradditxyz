## ✅ What's Clean

### Your Active Graddit Code:
- ✅ `/src/app/page.tsx` - Graddit homepage
- ✅ `/src/components/colleges/` - All Graddit components
- ✅ `/src/components/auth/` - Privy authentication
- ✅ `/src/components/FixedHeader.tsx` - Graddit header with logo
- ✅ `/src/app/api/colleges/` - Graddit APIs
- ✅ `/src/app/api/auth/` - Graddit auth APIs
- ✅ `/prisma/schema.prisma` - Graddit database schema
- ✅ `package.json` - Name: "graddit"

- ✅ `/public/gradditlogo.png` - Your logo

**NO Fluffle references in any active code!** ✅

## 📁 Unused Old Files (Don't Worry About These)

These files exist but are NOT used in your Graddit app:
- `/src/components/bingo/` - Old Fluffle bingo game
- `/src/components/nft/` - Old NFT tools
- `/src/components/metaverse/` - Old 3D viewer
- `/src/app/explore/` - Old explore page
- `/src/data/bingo.json` - Old data

**These are IGNORED and not loaded** in your Graddit app.

You can delete them later if you want, but they don't affect your site at all.

## 📊 What You Copied vs What's Active

### Copied (Template):
You used the Next.js project structure as a template, which included old Fluffle code.

### Active (Your Graddit):
Only these files run on your site:
```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx ← GRADDIT
│   ├── layout.tsx ← GRADDIT
│   ├── globals.css ← GRADDIT
│   └── api/
│       ├── colleges/ ← GRADDIT
│       └── auth/ ← GRADDIT
├── components/
│   ├── FixedHeader.tsx ← GRADDIT
│   ├── Footer.tsx ← GRADDIT
│   ├── colleges/ ← GRADDIT
│   └── auth/ ← GRADDIT
└── contexts/
    └── PrivyAuthContext.tsx ← GRADDIT
```

Everything else is dormant code that isn't executed.

## 🗑️ Want to Clean Up Old Files?

If you want to delete the unused Fluffle files later:

```bash
cd /Users/dhruv/Downloads/graddit-simple

# Delete old unused components
rm -rf src/components/bingo
rm -rf src/components/nft  
rm -rf src/components/metaverse
rm -rf src/components/builder
rm -rf src/components/pfp
rm -rf src/components/testnet
rm -rf src/app/explore

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Remove unused old components"
git push
```

But this is optional - they don't affect your live site at all!
